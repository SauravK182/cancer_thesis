Description: Personal functions created by me that speed up repeated
    differential gene expression and differential enrichment analyses with the
    DESeq2 and DiffBind packages. This package contains some (hopefully) useful
    functions that can be used to automate the process (in part) of repeatedly running
    bioinformatics pipelines to determine significant changes in the molecular state
    of gene expression.
